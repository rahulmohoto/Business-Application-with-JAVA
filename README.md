# Business-Application-with-JAVA
The application includes an interactive GUI where the retailer can input a certain quantity into the table of listed products and generate a sales sheet for the customer. Printing in A4 sheet is possible as well. If there is no printer is provided, **SAVE** is also possible to print later. It can be useful for a retail shop and distribution depot.  

## Instructions of use:
1. Test.xls file has to be saved on **local disk: D/** .
2. It's necessary to have installed JAVA on the operating machine. **JAVA version 1.8 or later** is compatible with the application.
3. As it has a fixed resolution, display can be a problem. Display scale at _720p_ is okay.
4. _SutonnyMj_ font was used while building the application. It is required to have that font.
